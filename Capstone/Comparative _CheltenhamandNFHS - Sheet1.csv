3/21/2020 18:46:46,John Dong,Male,10,,,5,4,4,"interesting, challenging, intriguing, rewarding, creative",3,2,2,4,3,They are very fun and interesting.,Obviously the robots were the main attraction and the little sprinkle of humor. I think younger students would enjoy this. I think I did not like how there was not a lot of time. ,It is hard to say since the second part of the event was unfortunately stopped due to the pandemic. Maybe we should interact with the robots and code while the presenter is speaking so that we can understand better the things that are being taught.,None
